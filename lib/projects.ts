      "Afridol is a digital platform designed to spotlight African creativity by connecting content creators, musicians, and artists with their fans. The platform blends social engagement with talent discovery, giving creators a space to showcase their work while enabling fans to interact, support, and request personalized services.",
    problem:
      "In Africa, many talented creators face challenges in:\n• Visibility: Limited opportunities to showcase their work globally\n• Monetization: Difficulty turning creative efforts into sustainable income\n• Engagement: Lack of a unified platform where fans can directly connect and support their favorite talents",
    process:
      "I designed Afridol with a human-first approach—starting with real conversations with creators and fans to uncover their struggles. Through research, wireframing, and iterative prototyping, I transformed these insights into a clean, modern platform that empowers creators to showcase their talent and gives fans a safe, seamless way to support them.",

      "The project helped me to learn more about the process of a design thinking framework. Learned to do better visuals with the material design guidelines, by creating a small component library. Also learned how to empathize with the users in a better way.",

The platform provides separate dashboards for students, parents, tutors, and administrators, ensuring that each stakeholder has access to the tools and insights they need for a seamless learning experience.",
    process:
      "I started by stepping into the shoes of the people who will actually use SC TUTOR — students, parents, tutors, and admins. Students need an easy way to learn, book sessions, and track progress. Parents want transparency, progress reports, and peace of mind. Tutors need flexible scheduling, resources management, and payment tracking. Admins need total control to keep the platform safe, fair, and smooth.",
